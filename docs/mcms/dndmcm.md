For Dungeons & Deviousness to work properly, the MCM and Skyrim in-game settings should be set as follows.

Before you get started, a word about difficulty: Dungeons & Deviousness is intended to be a semi-hardcore list with survival elements and a relatively high difficulty curve. Playing on either the Expert or Master difficulties is recommended.

* AVA
  * When you see a popup asking if you'd like to select your attributes, click "Yes" if you want to assign them now or "No" if you want to have a power (shout) added to your character to set them up later. Don't forget to do this, as without assigning attributes your character will be severely weakened! As with the difficulty, it is recommended that you pick either Expert or Master for the amount of points you get.

    <th class="warning"><b>WARNING:</b> Before doing anything with the MCM, wait for all the messages in the top left to finish appearing. Then, save your game and load the save you just created. Once that save has loaded, you must once again wait for all messages in the top left to disappear. Also, do not equip any weapons/spells until you have selected your Alternate Start or escaped the initial Alternate Start cell!</th>
