# How to Patch Anything

## Setup



## Step Zero
### Do you really have to patch this?

The first step whenever you think you need to patch something is to first look at what you are patching in relation to the other mods in the load order. If you can save yourself the trouble of creating a patch by moving the mod in the load order, you should always do this instead of creating a patch.

So, how do you know if this is the case? Let's look at an example.



## Step One
### Creating a Patch

The first thing you need to do if you do need to make a patch is to copy a record into a new ESL. Patches for LS3 should **always** be ESL flagged ESPs. We'll talk about that more in a moment.

So, find a record that you need to patch:

Right click on the header and select "Copy as overwrite..."

You will be prompted to select an ESP to copy the record into. As mentioned before, you should create a **new** ESL-flagged ESP for this patch. Name the patch as follows:

```
LS3 [Mod Name] Patch
```

Replacing [Mod Name] with an abbreviation of the name of whatever mod you are making a patch for.



## Step Two
### Patching

## Step Three
### Saving your Patch
